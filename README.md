The musesician project is one of the first projects I built using the vanilla HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

Although the project remains unfinished with some features to be added, such as enhancing the landing page with additional pages, implementing mobile responsiveness, including preloader, I would like to leave as it is.
I believe it will showcase my learning journey and demonstrate my progress in web development.

The web page I created for the musesician project is hosted and can be accessed through the following link: https://yarychok.github.io/musesician/. Feel free to visit the page to see the project in action.
